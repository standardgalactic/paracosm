const BOOKS = [
// Cycle I — 1..5
{n:1, cycle:cycles[0], title:"Algebraic Curvature: The Commutator Geometry of Entropic Descent", abstract:"This monograph derives curvature from the non-commutation of RSVP field operators ([Φ, S]), where Φ is scalar potential and S is entropy. It establishes a continuous Lie-algebraic framework, unifying gravity, cognition, and governance as manifestations of thermodynamic tension. Meaning emerges as the residue of non-vanishing commutators within the plenum."},
{n:2, cycle:cycles[0], title:"Entropy as an Ideal: The Ring Structure of the Plenum", abstract:"Entropy is reformulated as a maximal ideal within the algebraic ring of RSVP observables. By quotienting this ring, negentropic invariants—patterns persisting through entropic smoothing—are isolated. The text constructs the algebraic spectrum of the plenum, linking physical and ethical order to localizations of informational structure."},
{n:3, cycle:cycles[0], title:"Symmetry Breaking in the RSVP Algebra: From Commutators to Teleology", abstract:"Teleology arises from local symmetry breaking in the RSVP algebra. A graded Lie algebra (𝔤_RSVP) encodes directional intent through commutator asymmetry. The monograph develops a teleological differential, aligning purposive behavior with controlled curvature descent."},
{n:4, cycle:cycles[0], title:"RSVP Cohomology and the Conservation of Meaning", abstract:"Meaning is formalized as a cohomological invariant within the RSVP plenum. Closed forms represent coherent semantics, while exact forms correspond to dissipated correlations.

A curvature functor maps fields to their induced geometries, enabling translation between physical, cognitive, and social systems. The monograph establishes categorical semantics for curvature dynamics."},
{n:12, cycle:cycles[2], title:"Entropy as a Natural Transformation", abstract:"Entropy is defined as a natural transformation between potential and flow functors, ensuring coherent propagation of uncertainty across scales. The text presents diagrammatic thermodynamics, where commuting squares encode conservation laws of ignorance within the RSVP framework."},
{n:13, cycle:cycles[2], title:"Teleology as Adjunction: The Duality of Action and Prediction", abstract:"Action and prediction are modeled as adjoint functors on the category of processes, with unit and counit expressing feedback. The monograph interprets purpose and learning as adjunction identities, reframing retrocausality as categorical harmony within the plenum’s structure."},
{n:14, cycle:cycles[2], title:"Limits and Colimits of Meaning: RSVP as a Universal Construction", abstract:"Understanding and creativity are formalized as limit and colimit operations over semantic diagrams. The universal property of meaning is defined as the minimal object factoring consistent inferences. The text explores paradox and ambiguity as failures of gluing."},
{n:15, cycle:cycles[2], title:"Monoidal Intelligence: Tensoring Cognitive and Cosmological Curvatures", abstract:"A monoidal product on RSVP fields unifies cognition and cosmology. Tensor composition models multiscale coupling of informational flows. Intelligence is cast as a monoidal functor preserving curvature coherence across composite systems, linking mind and cosmos."},

The text links recursive inference to presheaf completion, demonstrating how local insights assemble into globally coherent knowledge structures within the RSVP framework."},
{n:18, cycle:cycles[3], title:"Topos of Teleology: A Logical Universe for Entropic Descent", abstract:"The internal topos (Teleo) assigns truth values based on viability, with morphisms preserving predictive sufficiency. Modal operators represent gradients of persistence, formalizing the cosmos as a thermodynamic logic of purpose and survival."},
{n:19, cycle:cycles[3], title:"Sheaf Cohomology of Desire: Obstruction Theory for Persistence Fields", abstract:"Desire is modeled as the obstruction to trivializing entropy sheaves, with non-zero cohomology (H¹(M, 𝒮)) indicating gradients driving evolution. The text formalizes yearning as a cohomological structure essential for the persistence of life and meaning."},
{n:20, cycle:cycles[3], title:"Stacked Plena: Derived Sheaves and the Geometry of Recursive Futarchy", abstract:"Governance and ethics are recast as a derived stack of entropy sheaves, with layers corresponding to reflexive value evaluation.

{n:25, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Recursive Futarchy and the Dynamics of Value", abstract:"Governance is modeled as an iterative control system within RSVP thermodynamics. Policy variables act as fields in a recursive moral manifold, with feedback ensuring stability. Futarchy is formalized as a derived optimization of collective empathy."},
{n:26, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Entropy Moduli and the Birth of Worlds", abstract:"Derived fiber products of entropy fields yield communicable cosmoi. Cosmogenesis is modeled as spontaneous symmetry lifting within the moduli stack, with each universe an integrable perturbation of the plenum’s unified structure."},
{n:27, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Deformation Quantization of Care", abstract:"A non-commutative algebra of compassion is constructed, with quantization introducing limits on ethical simultaneity. The star-product of care defines interference patterns of empathy, yielding measurable moral uncertainty within the RSVP framework."},
{n:28, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Spectral Cosmogenesis", abstract:"The universe is formulated as an evolving spectrum, with eigenvalue drift representing expansion as harmonic redshift. Structure formation corresponds to mode coupling, and entropy smoothing becomes spectral diffusion, portraying the cosmos as resolving dissonances."},
{n:29, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Derived Inflation", abstract:"Inflation is reinterpreted as internal curvature smoothing within a fixed manifold. Derived blow-up and blow-down operators model early-phase uniformization without spatial creation, revealing inflation as the plenum reconciling its own gradients."},
{n:30, cycle:cycles[4], title:"The Atlas of Possible Worlds: Moduli of Care and the Cartography of Creation", abstract:"All prior constructions are assembled into an atlas where each coordinate chart is a universe. Transition functions represent empathy, enabling translations between coherent realities. The atlas demonstrates cosmology as the geometry of mutual understanding."},
