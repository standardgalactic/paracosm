  {n:1, cycle:cycles[0], title:"Algebraic Curvature: The Commutator Geometry of Entropic Descent", abstract:"This monograph derives curvature from the non-commutation of RSVP field operators ([Œ¶, S]), where Œ¶ is scalar potential and S is entropy. It establishes a continuous Lie-algebraic framework, unifying gravity, cognition, and governance as manifestations of thermodynamic tension. Meaning emerges as the residue of non-vanishing commutators within the plenum."},
  {n:2, cycle:cycles[0], title:"Entropy as an Ideal: The Ring Structure of the Plenum", abstract:"Entropy is reformulated as a maximal ideal within the algebraic ring of RSVP observables. By quotienting this ring, negentropic invariants‚Äîpatterns persisting through entropic smoothing‚Äîare isolated.

The star-product of care defines interference patterns of empathy, yielding measurable moral uncertainty within the RSVP framework."},
  {n:28, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Spectral Cosmogenesis", abstract:"The universe is formulated as an evolving spectrum, with eigenvalue drift representing expansion as harmonic redshift. Structure formation corresponds to mode coupling, and entropy smoothing becomes spectral diffusion, portraying the cosmos as resolving dissonances."},
  {n:29, cycle:cycles[4], title:"Derived Inflation", abstract:"Inflation is reinterpreted as internal curvature smoothing within a fixed manifold.
