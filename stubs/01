## üìò **Book 1 ‚Äì Algebraic Curvature: The Commutator Geometry of Entropic Descent**

### **Abstract**

This book inaugurates the *Zero Day Exploits* series by developing the algebraic foundations of the Relativistic Scalar‚ÄìVector Plenum (RSVP).
It replaces metric curvature with **commutator curvature**‚Äîthe infinitesimal misalignment between scalar potential (Œ¶), vector flow (ùíó), and entropy (S).
The algebra is continuous, not discrete: every operation represents a smooth deformation in the plenum‚Äôs informational density.
Through Lie, graded, and BV algebras, the text reveals how **non-commutation gives rise to persistence, teleology, and ethical curvature**.
Meaning, desire, and gravity emerge as algebraic defects in an otherwise symmetric manifold.
