## üìó **Book 6 ‚Äî *Curvature Without Expansion: Differential Geometry in the Static Plenum***

### **Abstract**

Book 6 inaugurates the geometric tier of RSVP by replacing spacetime curvature with **thermodynamic curvature**.
In the non-expanding plenum, geometry is not about stretching but about smoothing: curvature measures how entropy gradients redistribute potential and flow.
The manifold‚Äôs connection, metric, and Ricci tensor are reinterpreted as derivatives of the scalar‚Äìvector‚Äìentropy fields ((\Phi,\boldsymbol{\mathcal{v}},S)).
Gravitational and cognitive forces alike arise from *entropic geodesics*: trajectories that minimize entropy production under the constraint of constant plenum volume.
This text provides the differential foundation for the entire second tier of the RSVP framework ‚Äî the bridge between algebraic commutators and categorical functors of curvature.

## üß≠ **Outline**

### **Front Matter**

* **Preface:** Why geometry follows algebra ‚Äî from commutator to connection.
* **Diagrammatic Overview:** The RSVP manifold as a static volume form with evolving entropy potential.
* **Reading Note:** Every curvature tensor henceforth is an entropic flux operator; space never expands.
