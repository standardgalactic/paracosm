## 📗 **Book 2 – *Curvature Without Expansion: Differential Geometry in the Static Plenum***

### **Abstract**

Book 2 advances the RSVP algebra into the realm of **thermodynamic differential geometry**, replacing metric expansion with **entropic smoothing**.
Here, curvature is not a deformation of spacetime but a continuous redistribution of scalar potential ( \Phi ), vector flow ( \boldsymbol{\mathcal{v}} ), and entropy ( S ) within a **non-expanding manifold**.
The work reconstructs classical geometric structures—connection, metric, geodesic, and Ricci flow—through RSVP’s informational ontology.
It shows how gravity, cognition, and preference arise as **geometric gradients of persistence**, and how the universe “smooths” rather than “stretches.”
Curvature thus becomes the geometry of care: a measure of how energy reorganizes itself to sustain meaning.

### **Bot Instruction Summary (for automated drafting)**

* Maintain the **non-expanding plenum constraint** (( \det g = \text{const} )).
* Express all curvature evolution in terms of **entropy gradients**, not spatial dilation.
* Each chapter must link formal geometry → empirical proxy → ethical reflection.
* Always include one reference to previous algebraic structure (Book 1) and one forward pointer to categorical generalization (Book 11).
* Verify that local oscillations preserve global ( \dot{S} > 0 ).
* Style: mathematically lucid, geometrically intuitive, philosophically resonant.
