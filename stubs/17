## üìò **Book 17 ‚Äî *Presheaves of Intelligibility: Local Sections of Meaning Across the Plenum***

### **Abstract**

Book 17 extends the RSVP sheaf formalism from thermodynamic fields to semantic and cognitive domains.
A **presheaf of intelligibility**, (\mathcal{I}), assigns to each open region (U\subset M) the set of interpretable structures‚Äîconcepts, observations, or linguistic propositions‚Äîvalid within (U).
Restriction maps encode translation of meaning from larger to smaller contexts.
Because these sections need not glue perfectly, presheaves capture *partial understanding* and the contextual drift of interpretation.
By introducing functorial semantics, derived limits, and dynamic restriction operators, the text shows how local meaning becomes global comprehension‚Äîand how loss, irony, or misunderstanding manifest as presheaf inconsistencies.
It provides the mathematical foundation for cognitive modeling, semantic AI, and epistemic ethics within RSVP‚Äôs static plenum.

## üß≠ **Outline**

### **Front Matter**

* **Preface:** From entropy to intelligibility ‚Äî how understanding acquires locality.
* **Diagrammatic Overview:** Relationship between entropy sheaves (Book 16) and semantic presheaves.
* **Reading Note:** Meaning lives in overlaps; coherence is never global from the start.

### **Part I ‚Äì Defining the Presheaf of Meaning**

#### **Chapter 1 ‚Äì The Semantic Base Space**

1. Let (M) be the thermodynamic manifold of experience.
2. Each open set (U\subset M) represents a cognitive or observational context.
3. Morphisms of the base category = inclusion (V\hookrightarrow U).
4. Example: overlapping sensory fields or social subdomains.

#### **Chapter 2 ‚Äì Definition of the Presheaf of Intelligibility**

1. Define functor
   [
   \mathcal{I}: \mathbf{Open}(M)^{op}!\to!\mathbf{Set},
   \quad
   U\mapsto \text{set of interpretive models on }U.
   ]
2. Restriction (r_{UV}:\mathcal{I}(U)!\to!\mathcal{I}(V)) models contextual translation.
3. Presheaf axioms (identity + functoriality).
4. Interpretation: knowledge that can always be *narrowed* but not always *unified*.

---

### **Part II ‚Äì Functorial Semantics of Understanding**

#### **Chapter 3 ‚Äì Morphisms of Intelligibility**

1. Morphism between presheaves = translation between interpretive schemes.
2. Composition ‚Üî semantic chaining of reasoning steps.
3. Example: interdisciplinary translation or metaphor.
4. RSVP reading: meaning as morphism preserving curvature of sense.

#### **Chapter 4 ‚Äì Functorial Limits and Coherence**

1. Compute limit of presheaf diagram = shared core meaning.
2. Colimit = integrated narrative or worldview.
3. Partial gluing expressed through non-trivial limit cones.
4. Visualization: semantic networks merging through common concepts.

---

### **Part III ‚Äì Sheafification and Lossy Gluing**

#### **Chapter 5 ‚Äì From Presheaf to Sheaf**

1. Apply sheafification functor (a:\mathbf{PSh}!\to!\mathbf{Sh}).
2. (a(\mathcal{I})) = sheaf of fully consistent interpretations.
3. Kernel of the adjunction (a\dashv i) = unintelligible residue.
4. Ethical meaning: education as sheafification of local minds.

#### **Chapter 6 ‚Äì Lossy Restriction and Forgetting**

1. Define forgetting operator (f_{UV}): non-faithful restriction.
2. Quantify semantic entropy: (H_{UV}=-\log|\mathrm{Im}(f_{UV})|).
3. Model memory decay and bias as presheaf deformation.
4. Learning = iterative correction restoring functoriality.

---

### **Part IV ‚Äì Dynamics of Meaning Flow**

#### **Chapter 7 ‚Äì Differential of Restriction**

1. Define infinitesimal restriction
   [
   D\mathcal{I}(U)=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\frac{\mathcal{I}(U)-\mathcal{I}(U_\epsilon)}{\epsilon}.
   ]
2. Interpret as sensitivity of understanding to context.
3. Analogy: cognitive gradient descent on semantic manifold.
4. Application: language-model fine-tuning as presheaf differentiation.

#### **Chapter 8 ‚Äì Temporal Presheaves**

1. Extend base category to ( \mathbf{Open}(M)\times \mathbf{Time}).
2. Sections evolve under teleodynamic update rule
   ( \partial_t \mathcal{I} = -\nabla_S \mathcal{I}).
3. Capture adaptive learning and re-contextualization.
4. Ethical reflection: growth as continuity of meaning over time.

---

### **Part V ‚Äì Epistemic and Ethical Geometry**

#### **Chapter 9 ‚Äì Local Truth and Relational Logic**

1. Interpret (\mathcal{I}(U)) as local Heyting algebra of propositions.
2. Define logical morphisms preserving entailment under restriction.
3. Connect to topos-theoretic internal logic (Book 18).
4. Insight: truth is always open-set dependent.

#### **Chapter 10 ‚Äì Ethics of Partial Understanding**

1. Incomplete overlap ‚Üí misunderstanding ‚Üí informational curvature.
2. Repair via new overlaps or mediator morphisms.
3. Compassion = willingness to extend the cover.
4. Transition to Book 18 (*Topos of Teleology*).

---

### **Part VI ‚Äì Empirical and Computational Horizons**

#### **Chapter 11 ‚Äì Implementing Presheaf Models**

1. Construct presheaves over data graphs or sensorimotor networks.
2. Use categorical databases for contextual inference.
3. Evaluate coherence via restriction-consistency metrics.
4. Applications: contextual LLM reasoning, distributed cognition.

#### **Chapter 12 ‚Äì Measurement and Responsibility**

1. Observation as restriction functor (r_{UV}).
2. Non-invertibility = ethical cost of measurement.
3. ‚ÄúTo observe is to reduce context.‚Äù
4. Epilogue: *‚ÄúIntelligibility begins where overlap invites humility.‚Äù*
