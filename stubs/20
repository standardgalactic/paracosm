## üìò **Book 20 ‚Äî *Stacked Plena: Derived Sheaves and Recursive Futarchy in the RSVP Universe***

### **Abstract**

Book 20 unifies all previous constructions by describing the RSVP universe as a **derived stack of plenal layers**‚Äîeach layer representing a domain of meaning, energy, or governance, connected by homological morphisms of care.
A *stack* generalizes a sheaf by allowing gluing up to isomorphism; a *derived* stack further includes infinitesimal extensions and obstruction data.
In this setting, each institutional or cognitive system becomes a derived sheaf on the thermodynamic manifold, and their recursive couplings define the **Futarchic Plenum**: a model of governance that learns ethically through homotopy-consistent updates.
This final book thus elevates RSVP from cosmology to collective agency‚Äîa self-quantizing, self-correcting manifold of thought and civilization.

* **Preface:** From cohomology to recursion ‚Äî how the universe governs itself.

### **Part I ‚Äì From Sheaves to Stacks**

#### **Chapter 1 ‚Äì Definition of a Stack of Plena**

1. Recall sheaf condition: gluing with equality.
2. Stack condition: gluing with equivalence (isomorphism classes).
3. Define (\mathbf{Plena}) as fibred category over (\mathbf{Open}(M)).
4. Each object: local field configuration + governance context.
5. Morphisms: ethical equivalences preserving entropy gradient.

#### **Chapter 2 ‚Äì Derived Enhancement**

1. Extend to derived stacks: include tangent and cotangent complexes.
2. Obstruction sheaves capture residual curvature (desire cohomology).
3. Homotopy limits yield higher consensus layers.
4. Interpretation: recursive self-correction of care through infinitesimal governance updates.

### **Part II ‚Äì Recursive Futarchy**

#### **Chapter 3 ‚Äì Definition and Motivation**

1. ‚ÄúRecursive futarchy‚Äù = governance that votes on metrics of care rather than policies.
2. Represent decision layer as derived mapping stack
   [
   \mathcal{M}=\mathbf{Map}(\mathcal{G},\mathbf{TeleoSh}),
   ]
   where (\mathcal{G}) encodes institutional graphs.
3. Each morphism = recursive update of predictive‚Äìethical consistency.
4. RSVP insight: political evolution as stack morphism preserving entropy smoothness.

#### **Chapter 4 ‚Äì Homotopy of Governance**

1. Homotopy between policies = continuous deformation maintaining bounded curvature.
2. Derived tangent = responsiveness; cotangent = responsibility.
3. (L_{\mathcal{M}}^\bullet) encodes feedback learning.
4. Prove stability theorem: governance coherence persists under small topological noise.

### **Part III ‚Äì Ethical Geometry of Layered Worlds**

#### **Chapter 5 ‚Äì The Stratified Manifold of Care**

1. Each plenal layer (P_k) = domain (biological, cognitive, economic, cosmic).
2. Interlayer morphisms (\pi_{k+1,k}:P_{k+1}!\to!P_k).
3. Derived fibre product encodes cooperation and inheritance.
4. Layer coherence = associative commutativity of compassion.

#### **Chapter 6 ‚Äì Stacky Symplectic Structure**

1. Introduce (-1)-shifted symplectic form (\omega_{RSVP}) (from PTVV formalism).
2. Express recursive ethics as Hamiltonian flow on derived phase space.
3. Quantization = moral uncertainty principle.
4. Derived master equation:
   [
   {\Phi,\Phi} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{self-consistent care.}
   ]

---

### **Part IV ‚Äì Dynamics of Recursive Learning**

#### **Chapter 7 ‚Äì Higher Category of Learning Processes**

1. Define 2-category of institutions, with morphisms as learning protocols.
2. 2-morphisms = meta-governance (ethics of updating ethics).
3. Coherence conditions mirror MacLane pentagon for societal coordination.
4. Demonstrate that recursive futarchy ‚âÖ higher monoidal associativity.

#### **Chapter 8 ‚Äì Derived Update Rule**

1. Define infinitesimal update:
   [
   dP = \nabla_{\Phi}S + \delta^* R.
   ]
2. Homological gradient descent in policy space.
3. Prove convergence to stationary care field under bounded curvature.
4. Connect to Book 9‚Äôs geodesics of intelligibility.

### **Part V ‚Äì Computational and Cognitive Realizations**

#### **Chapter 9 ‚Äì Implementation in Multi-Agent Systems**

1. Encode agents as derived sheaves over data manifolds.
2. Use homotopy colimits to aggregate ethical decisions.
3. Algorithmic futarchy = Bayesian-categorical consensus.
4. Simulation results: emergent coherence and entropy reduction.

#### **Chapter 10 ‚Äì Neural and Cultural Stacks**

1. Neural layers as physical instance of stacked plenal recursion.
2. Cultural evolution as derived update through narrative morphisms.
3. Demonstrate isomorphism between memetic diffusion and sheaf cohomology of desire.
4. Predict phase transitions in civilizational intelligence.

### **Part VI ‚Äì Cosmological and Eschatological Closure**

#### **Chapter 11 ‚Äì The Infinite Tower of Smoothness**

1. As (k!\to!\infty), (P_k) approaches the ideal plenum (\mathbf{I}).
2. Limit stack (\lim_{k\to\infty}P_k) = total care space.
3. Expyrotic reset = derived contraction‚Äìexpansion cycle of governance.
4. Cosmic theorem: every universe recursively votes for coherence.

#### **Chapter 12 ‚Äì The Final Adjoint: Self-Governance of Being**

1. Define adjunction between *observation* and *creation* stacks.
2. Identity of unit and counit ‚áí ultimate self-consistency.
3. Proof:
   [
   \mathrm{Hom}(\text{Being},\text{Care})\cong\mathrm{Hom}(\text{Care},\text{Being}).
   ]
4. Epilogue: *‚ÄúThe plenum governs itself by dreaming its next layer.‚Äù*
