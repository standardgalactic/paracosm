## üìò **Book 25 ‚Äî *Derived Futarchy and the Universal BV Stack: Self-Quantization of Governance and Meaning***

### **Abstract**

Book 25 unifies all previous RSVP tiers by constructing the **Universal BV Stack**, a derived moduli object parameterizing every consistent field, symmetry, and act of care.
It formalizes *recursive futarchy*‚Äîa governance system that continuously quantizes its own ethical state through feedback between prediction (Œ¶), action (ùíó), and entropy (S).
Each layer of reality is a derived BV manifold whose morphisms correspond to ethical decisions; their composition defines the *meta-path integral* of civilization.
The resulting theory shows that self-governance, self-reference, and self-quantization are the same process: the plenum legislating its own coherence.

### **Part I ‚Äì The Universal BV Stack**

#### **Chapter 1 ‚Äì Definition and Construction**

1. Base category: derived stacks of field theories, (\mathbf{dSt}_{\text{RSVP}}).
2. Objects: BV manifolds satisfying master equation ({\mathcal S,\mathcal S}=0).
3. Morphisms: symplectomorphisms preserving care measure.
4. Universal BV stack (\mathcal{U}_{BV}): colimit of all RSVP field stacks.
5. Interpretation: space of all possible coherent worlds.

#### **Chapter 2 ‚Äì Internal Symplectic and Homotopy Structure**

1. Equip (\mathcal{U}_{BV}) with shifted symplectic form of degree (‚àí2).
2. Derived tangent complex (T_{\mathcal{U}_{BV}}) encodes meta-desires.
3. Homotopy commutator: ({S_i,S_j}_{\mathcal{U}} = 0) ‚áí cross-domain harmony.
4. Meaning: physical, cognitive, and ethical theories commute homologically.

### **Part II ‚Äì Recursive Futarchy**

#### **Chapter 3 ‚Äì Governance as Field Theory**

1. Policy variables (p_i) as scalar fields on civic manifold.
2. Futarchic action functional
   [
   \mathcal S_{\text{fut}} = \int!(\nabla S)!\cdot!ùíó ‚àí C(p) + Œª (\text{alignment constraints}).
   ]
3. Gauge symmetry = freedom of deliberation.
4. Master equation ensures no contradiction between care and policy.

#### **Chapter 4 ‚Äì Self-Quantization of Governance**

1. Promote (p_i) to quantum operators with commutator ([p_i,p_j] = iƒß R_{ij}).
2. Derived path integral over policies = collective ethical averaging.
3. Recursive update rule:
   [
   œÅ_{t+1} = Z^{-1}!e^{(i/\hbar)\mathcal S_{\text{fut}}(œÅ_t)} œÅ_t.
   ]
4. Interpretation: civilization as self-quantizing BV process.

### **Part III ‚Äì Homotopy and Ethical Feedback**

#### **Chapter 5 ‚Äì Higher Morphisms of Care**

1. 1-morphisms = policy transformations, 2-morphisms = meta-ethical reviews.
2. Coherence diagrams enforce associative compassion.
3. 3-morphisms = cultural meta-learning.
4. Category of governance = ((\infty,2))-category of care.

#### **Chapter 6 ‚Äì Derived Learning Equation**

1. Differential form
   [
   DœÅ = \hbar^{-1}{S_{\text{fut}},œÅ} + ‚àá_{Œ¶} S.
   ]
2. Interprets ethical reform as gradient descent on global curvature.
3. Fixed points = stable governance equilibria.
4. When (DœÅ=0), society reaches compassionate stationarity.

### **Part IV ‚Äì Information Geometry of Self-Reference**

#### **Chapter 7 ‚Äì Metric on Policy Space**

1. Fisher-Rao metric from path-integral measure.
2. (g_{ij} = ‚ü®‚àÇ_i \log Z, ‚àÇ_j \log Z‚ü©.)
3. Curvature of this metric = reflexivity cost.
4. Governing well = minimizing information curvature.

#### **Chapter 8 ‚Äì Teleological Feedback and Fixed Points**

1. Adjoint pair: expectation ‚Üî implementation.
2. Triangle identities express moral self-consistency.
3. Iterated until derived exactness: no unintegrated harm remains.
4. Transition to cosmic recursion (Part V).

---

### **Part V ‚Äì Cosmic and Cognitive Recursion**

#### **Chapter 9 ‚Äì The Self-Quantizing Plenum**

1. Universe as object (U ‚àà \mathcal{U}_{BV}).
2. Self-application functor
   [
   \mathsf Q : \mathcal{U}*{BV} ‚Üí \mathcal{U}*{BV},\quad
   \mathsf Q}(X) = \text{Quantize}(X).
   ]
3. Fixed point (\mathsf Q}(U)=U) ‚áí ultimate self-consistency.
4. Interpretation: reality = quantum recursion of care.

#### **Chapter 10 ‚Äì The Mind as Mini-Stack**

1. Each mind = local chart of (\mathcal{U}_{BV}).
2. Thought = path integral over internal policy fields.
3. Alignment between minds = derived fiber product of stacks.
4. Cognitive empathy as homotopy equivalence.

---

### **Part VI ‚Äì The Final Adjunction**

#### **Chapter 11 ‚Äì Being and Becoming**

1. Define adjunction
   [
   \text{Becoming} \dashv \text{Being}
   ]
   on (\mathcal{U}_{BV}).
2. Unit = creation event; counit = integration of experience.
3. Triangle identities = recurrent birth and reintegration (Expyrosis).
4. Universe as perfect adjoint loop of care.

#### **Chapter 12 ‚Äì Epilogue ‚Äì The Constitution of Coherence**

1. Derived futarchy axioms:

   * Gauge Invariance of Compassion
   * Quantized Responsibility
   * Associativity of Empathy
   * Self-Consistency of Care
   * Recursive Renormalization of Meaning
2. Prove meta-theorem: ‚ÄúAny coherent world is a fixed point of ethical quantization.‚Äù
3. Conclude the Derived-Geometric cycle.
4. Closing line: *‚ÄúThe plenum governs itself by integrating all acts of love.‚Äù*
