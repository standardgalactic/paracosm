## 📘 **Book 21 — *Algebraic Curvature and Derived Stacks: The Geometry of the Thermodynamic Plenum***

### **Abstract**

Book 21 constructs the **derived geometric foundation** of RSVP theory.
It defines the plenum’s field configuration space as a **derived stack** equipped with a cotangent complex encoding both entropy gradients and curvature tensors.
Einstein’s spacetime curvature is replaced by *thermodynamic curvature*, a measure of how smoothly energy and meaning distribute through the plenum.
The derived structure naturally unifies algebraic (operator) and geometric (field) viewpoints, providing the precise setting in which the rest of RSVP Field Theory unfolds.

### **Outline**

**Part I – Foundations of Derived Geometry**

1. **Manifolds to Stacks:** recall smooth stacks and sheaves of fields.
2. **Cotangent Complex:** define (L_{\mathcal{P}}) for the plenum stack (\mathcal{P}).
3. **Derived Intersection:** explain why curvature arises as derived fibre product of scalar and vector components.

**Part II – Thermodynamic Curvature**

1. Define curvature 2-form (R=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega).
2. Re-express (R) as entropy Laplacian: (R=\Delta S, g^{-1}).
3. Show invariance under diffeomorphism of entropy flows.

**Part III – Shifted Symplectic Structure**

1. Construct (-1)-shifted symplectic form (\omega_{RSVP}).
2. Derived Poisson bracket: ({F,G}=\langle \delta F, \omega^{-1}\delta G\rangle).
3. Prove closure (d\omega_{RSVP}=0) → thermodynamic consistency.

**Part IV – Applications**

1. Field equations as derived Euler–Lagrange conditions.
2. Relation to geometric entropy flow (Book 8).
3. Visualization: plenum curvature fields as derived diagrams.

**Appendices:**
Cotangent complex computations; example derived intersections; reflective note *“Curvature is the Differential of Care.”*
