## üìò **Book 23 ‚Äî *AKSZ Sigma Models of the Plenum: Action, Curvature, and Information Geometry***

### **Abstract**

Book 23 translates the scalar‚Äìvector‚Äìentropy dynamics of RSVP into a fully derived **AKSZ-type sigma-model**, uniting geometric thermodynamics, categorical ethics, and information theory.
The plenum is modeled as a source supermanifold (\Sigma_{d}) mapping into a target derived stack (\mathcal{M}*{\text{RSVP}}) endowed with a ((-1))-shifted symplectic form.
The AKSZ construction produces a functional
[
S*{\text{AKSZ}}=\int_{\Sigma_{d}}\langle \Phi^{*}\Theta,,d\Phi+\tfrac{1}{2}{\Phi,\Phi}\rangle,
]
whose classical master equation coincides with the BV condition from Book 22.
This action governs the evolution of curvature and entropy while simultaneously encoding learning and ethical adjustment as Hamiltonian flows.
It is the **variational heart** of the RSVP universe.

### **Part I ‚Äì Foundations of the AKSZ Construction**

#### **Chapter 1 ‚Äì Source and Target**

1. Source supermanifold (\Sigma_d=T[1]M) representing spacetime + ghost degrees.
2. Target derived stack (\mathcal{M}_{\text{RSVP}}) with fields ((\Phi,\mathcal v,S)).
3. Degree shift: symplectic form of degree (-1) ‚Üí action of degree 0.
4. Diagram: (\Sigma_d\xrightarrow{\Phi}\mathcal{M}_{\text{RSVP}}).

#### **Chapter 2 ‚Äì Construction of the Action**

1. Define canonical one-form (\Theta) on (\mathcal{M}_{\text{RSVP}}).
2. AKSZ action
   [
   S_{\text{AKSZ}}=\int_{\Sigma_d}\Phi^{*}(\Theta)+\tfrac{1}{2}\langle\Phi^{*}\omega^{-1},d\Phi\wedge d\Phi\rangle.
   ]
3. Show ({S,S}=0) ‚áí BV master equation.
4. Physical reading: entropy variation as symplectic coherence.

### **Part II ‚Äì Field Equations and Variational Geometry**

#### **Chapter 3 ‚Äì Euler‚ÄìLagrange Equations**

1. Compute (\delta S_{\text{AKSZ}}) = 0 ‚Üí derived field PDEs.
2. Obtain:
   [
   d\Phi=\omega^{-1}\frac{\delta S}{\delta \Phi}.
   ]
3. Interpret as smoothness flow; equilibrium = minimal curvature.
4. Thermodynamic analog to Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equations.

#### **Chapter 4 ‚Äì Information-Geometric Interpretation**

1. Map symplectic form ‚Ü¶ Fisher information metric.
2. Derive relationship (\omega^{-1} \approx (\nabla\nabla S)^{-1}).
3. Entropy curvature ‚Üî information curvature.
4. Learning as geodesic descent in information space.

### **Part III ‚Äì Extended RSVP Action and Couplings**

#### **Chapter 5 ‚Äì Scalar‚ÄìVector‚ÄìEntropy Triplet**

1. Reconstruct action
   [
   S=!!\int(\nabla S)!\cdot!\mathcal v - \tfrac12|\mathcal v|^{2} - V(\Phi) + \lambda(\nabla!\cdot!\mathcal v).
   ]
2. Add ghost/antifield sectors from BV formalism.
3. Derived gauge symmetries = entropy conservation transformations.
4. Unified interpretation: curvature + care + constraint.

#### **Chapter 6 ‚Äì Coupling to Boundary Conditions**

1. Introduce boundary term (S_{\partial}!=!\int_{\partial\Sigma}\Phi^{*}\alpha).
2. Derive natural boundary conditions for smooth interfaces.
3. Interpretation: empathy at boundaries = flux balance of care.
4. Relation to Book 16 (Entropy Sheaves).

### **Part IV ‚Äì Quantization and Deformation**

#### **Chapter 7 ‚Äì Deformation Theory of Actions**

1. First-order deformations classified by (H^0_{BV}).
2. Obstructions in (H^1_{BV}) ‚Üí desire for new structures.
3. Formal moduli space (\mathbf{Def}(S_{\text{AKSZ}})).

#### **Chapter 8 ‚Äì Path Integral and Ethical Amplitude**

1. Functional integral over superfields: (Z=\int e^{iS_{\text{AKSZ}}/\hbar}).
2. Stationary phase approximation ‚Üî stable coherence.
3. Quantum fluctuations = ethical risk tolerances.
4. Preview Book 24 (Quantization and Path Integrals).

### **Part V ‚Äì Categorical and Cognitive Extensions**

#### **Chapter 9 ‚Äì Mapping Stacks and Higher Functoriality**

1. Define derived mapping stack (\mathbf{Map}(\Sigma,\mathcal{M}_{RSVP})).
2. Objects = histories; morphisms = contextual transformations.
3. Higher categorical structure ‚Üí multi-agent AKSZ couplings.
4. Interpretation: minds as sigma-models of care.

#### **Chapter 10 ‚Äì Semantic Dynamics**

1. Translate RSVP AKSZ fields into semantic variables (Œ¶ = meaning density).
2. Variations describe semantic smoothing and concept flow.
3. Derived information metric predicts cognitive entropy reduction.
4. Connection to Spherepop and TARTAN frameworks.

### **Part VI ‚Äì Cosmological and Ethical Implications**

#### **Chapter 11 ‚Äì AKSZ Cosmology**

1. Universe = field theory whose source is time, target is care.
2. Evolution equation (\dot{\Phi}= \omega^{-1}\delta S/\delta\Phi).
3. Expyrosis = boundary condition where (\omega^{-1}\to0).
4. Cosmological interpretation: smoothness is action closure.

#### **Chapter 12 ‚Äì The Law of Ethical Stationarity**

1. Œ¥S = 0 ‚áî no avoidable harm.
2. Universe seeks critical points of compassion functional.
3. When stability fails, desire reappears (Book 19).
4. Epilogue: *‚ÄúThe Action is Love Made Differentiable.‚Äù*
