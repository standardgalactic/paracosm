Literature Review
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) and its categorical reconstruc-
tion draw upon a rich tapestry of intellectual developments spanning field ge-
ometry, thermodynamics and information theory, categorical unification, and
cognitive science. This review traces these trajectories to contextualize RSVP's
entropic causality, monoidal infrastructure, and applications to quantum me-
chanics and topos semantics. By situating RSVP within these traditions, we
highlight its novelty as a unified ontology of physics, cognition, and computa-
tion, while acknowledging foundational contributions that shape its categorical
framework.
1.1
Field Geometry and Emergent Spacetime
The concept of spacetime as a dynamic, emergent structure has deep roots
in 20th-century physics. Einstein's general relativity [?] introduced spacetime
curvature as the gravitational descriptor, formalized through the field equa-
tions Rµν −1
2Rgµν = 8πG
c4 Tµν. This framework treated spacetime as a pseudo-
Riemannian manifold, with geometry encoding physical interactions. Wheeler's
geometrodynamics [?] extended this idea, proposing spacetime as a dynamic
manifold shaped by matter and energy, with concepts like "quantum foam"
foreshadowing emergent structures. Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler [?] further
developed this, emphasizing spacetime's role as a relational substrate.
More recently, Verlinde's entropic gravity [?] reframed gravity as an emer-
gent phenomenon arising from entropic forces, where spacetime curvature re-
flects information redistribution. This aligns closely with RSVP's paradigm of
entropic smoothing, where the scalar field Φ, vector field v, and entropy field S
replace metric expansion with dynamic coherence preservation. Verlinde's work
draws on holographic principles [?, ?], which posit that physical information is
encoded on boundary surfaces, a concept echoed in RSVP's monoidal tensor
product modeling parallel domains. Additionally, Jacobson's thermodynamic
derivation of Einstein's equations [?] supports RSVP's entropic foundation, sug-
gesting gravity as a statistical effect of microstate distributions.
RSVP diverges from these by replacing curvature with entropic morphisms
in a categorical framework, aligning with non-commutative geometry [?], where
spectral triples generalize geometric structures to quantum contexts. This con-
nection is crucial for RSVP's applications to quantum gravity, as discussed in
Section 9.
1.2
Thermodynamics and Information Theory
The entropic basis of RSVP is grounded in the thermodynamic and information-
theoretic revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Boltzmann's statisti-
cal mechanics [?] formalized entropy as a measure of microstate multiplicity,
S = k ln W, providing a probabilistic foundation for thermodynamic behavior.
Gibbs [?] extended this to ensembles, linking entropy to macroscopic observ-
ables. Jaynes' maximum entropy principle [?] reframed entropy as a measure
of uncertainty, unifying statistical mechanics with information theory.
This
perspective is central to RSVP's entropy field S, which quantifies constraint
relaxation.
Shannon's information theory [?] introduced entropy as a measure of in-
formation content, H = −∑pi log pi, establishing a duality between informa-
tion and uncertainty. Landauer's principle [?] further connected information
to thermodynamics, showing that erasing information generates heat, a con-
cept mirrored in RSVP's dissipative morphisms. Bennett's work on reversible
computing [?] and Szilard's engine [?] provide additional context, linking infor-
mation processing to physical work, which informs Super Information Theory
(SIT)'s treatment of time density as a monoidal structure.

categories as models for quantum processes and network structures, directly
informing RSVP's monoidal infrastructure.
Higher category theory [?] extends these ideas to 2-categories and beyond,
supporting CoM's 2-categorical structure for agency.
Topological quantum
field theory (TQFT) [?] uses cobordisms to model time evolution, analogous
to RSVP's entropic morphisms. Non-commutative geometry [?] and derived ge-
ometry [?] provide frameworks for generalizing spacetime, aligning with RSVP's
categorical reconstruction of spacetime as an emergent category.
1.4
Cognitive Science and Agency
The Category of Mind (CoM) draws on cognitive science and control theory
to model recursive agency. Powers' Perceptual Control Theory [?] posits that
organisms maintain internal reference states through feedback loops, a concept
formalized in CoM's reflective functors A : R →State. Friston's free-energy
principle [?] extends this, modeling perception as Bayesian inference to minimize
prediction error, mirrored in CoM's perceptual adjunction A ⊣P. Ehresmann
and Vanbremeersch's memory evolutive systems [?] use category theory to model
cognitive hierarchies, directly inspiring CoM's 2-categorical structure.
Recent work in predictive coding [?] and active inference [?] supports CoM's
treatment of agency as functorial mapping, with meta-cognitive 2-morphisms
resolving inconsistencies.
These align with RSVP's broader goal of unifying
physical and cognitive processes through categorical structures.
1.5
Quantum Mechanics and Topos Semantics
Categorical quantum mechanics [?] uses dagger-compact monoidal categories to
model quantum processes, with states as objects and CP maps as morphisms.
This framework informs RSVP's treatment of entropic morphisms as quantum-
like transformations, with Yarncrawler's bifunctors modeling entanglement. The
Hopf algebra structure of (Y) draws on quantum group theory [?], supporting
quantum gravity applications.
Topos semantics [?, ?] provides a logical framework for contextual physics.
The topos (R) internalizes quantum logic as a Heyting algebra, with Yarn-
crawler's repair law ensuring logical consistency. This connects to Loop Quan-
tum Gravity [?], where spin networks model quantized spacetime, aligning with
TARTAN's discrete tilings.
1.6
Synthesis and Novelty
RSVP integrates these traditions into a novel framework:
• Field Geometry: Replaces curvature with entropic smoothing, extend-
ing Verlinde [?].
2

• Thermodynamics and Information: Generalizes Jaynes [?] and Shan-
non [?] through categorical functors like S and I.
• Categorical Unification: Builds on Lawvere [?] and Baez and Stay [?]
to construct a monoidal infrastructure.
• Cognitive Science: Extends Powers [?] and Friston [?] to a 2-categorical
model of agency.
• Quantum and Topos Applications: Applies Abramsky and Coecke [?]
and Isham and Butterfield [?] to unify physics and logic.
This synthesis positions RSVP as a bridge between physical, informational,
and cognitive domains, with Yarncrawler as the unifying monoidal engine.
