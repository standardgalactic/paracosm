Abstract
This paper presents a categorical and sheaf-theoretic reconstruction of the Relativistic Scalar Vec-
tor Plenum (RSVP), interpreting the scalar-vector-entropy field triad (Φ, v, S) as the foundational
layer of a higher-order semantic infrastructure.
RSVP defines the physical substrate of continu-
ity, over which successive categorical layers—Unified Field Theory of Coherence (UFTC-SF), Super
Information Theory (SIT), Category of Mind (CoM), Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with An-
notated Noise (TARTAN), and Yarncrawler—are constructed.
Each layer implements a distinct
functorial correspondence: coherence, information, agency, recursive simulation, and infrastructural
repair.
Yarncrawler serves as the monoidal inference engine, formalizing reality as a recursively
self-repairing category of semantic coherence. Applications to categorical quantum mechanics model
quantum processes as entropic morphisms, while topos semantics internalizes logical consistency.
Expanded cohomological proofs demonstrate exactness, ensuring systemic self-consistency. The pa-
per concludes with implications for quantum gravity, framing spacetime as an emergent category of
entropic repair.

Introduction
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) offers a paradigm shift, departing from classical models
of metrically expanding spacetime to a continuum governed by recursive entropic smoothing. Local field
configurations dynamically adjust to preserve total coherence, manifesting apparent expansion without
extrinsic inflationary mechanisms [?]. The scalar field Φ quantifies plenum density, the vector field v
directs coherence flows, and the entropy field S measures constraint relaxation balanced by negentropic
feedback. The fundamental dynamic is:
∂tΦ + ∇· (Φv) = λ∇2S,
where λ is a coupling constant, and ∇2S acts as a lamphrodyne operator for structured entropy
diffusion.
Historically, RSVP integrates field geometry, thermodynamics, and categorical semantics. This paper
formalizes RSVP through category theory and sheaf theory, constructing a hierarchical stack culminating
in a self-repairing semantic infrastructure. The layers—RSVP, UFTC-SF, SIT, CoM, TARTAN, and
Yarncrawler—build from physical continuity to monoidal repair. Mathematical rigor is achieved through
explicit definitions, functors, adjunctions, and cohomological sequences.
Applications to categorical
quantum mechanics [?] and topos theory [?] demonstrate versatility, with quantum gravity framing
spacetime as emergent from entropic morphisms.

Literature Review
The RSVP and its categorical reconstruction draw upon field geometry, thermodynamics and informa-
tion theory, categorical unification, and cognitive science. This review contextualizes RSVP's entropic

The Base Category R: Entropic Continuity
Define R:
- Objects: Configurations r = (Φr, vr, Sr), satisfying:
∆Φr + ∇· (Φrvr ⊗µr) = 0.
- Morphisms: Transformations f : r1 →r2, preserving:

Ω
˙S dµ = 0.
- Tensor Product: r1 ⊗r2 = (Φ1 + Φ2, v1 ⊕v2, S1 + S2). - Unit: I = (Φ0, 0, 0).
R is symmetric monoidal, with braiding βr1,r2. The entropy functor S : R →assigns Sr(Ω). This
models the plenum as self-cohering [?].

The Sheaf of Coherence C: UFTC-SF
Define the sheaf:
C : R →Vect,
with C(r) as phase-locked functions, and restriction maps ρri,rj. The gluing axiom ensures:
si|ri∩rj = sj|ri∩rj ⇒∃!s ∈C(∪iri).
The global section functor Γ(R, C) defines coherence, analogous to gauge connections [?].

Super Information Theory (SIT): The Information-Density
Functor
Define:
I : R →Mon,

.
The adjunction S ⊣I:
(S(r), X) ∼= (I(r), F(X)),
generalizes Shannon's duality [?].

Category of Mind (CoM): Recursive Agency
CoM is a 2-category A:
- 0-Cells: Agents A : R →State. - 1-Morphisms: Perceptual transformations. - 2-Morphisms:
Meta-revisions.
The adjunction A ⊣P ensures reflection [?, ?].

TARTAN: Recursive Tiling and Annotated Noise
Define:
T : R →Grid,
with cochain complex Rt = ∑wk∇kΦ, dΦ = N, d2 = 0, modeling coherence histories [?].

Yarncrawler: The Monoidal Infrastructure Functor
Yarncrawler is:
Y : R × A →Struct,
with objects y = Y(r, A) satisfying:
∂y = δ(S) −δ(Coherence) = 0.
Monoidal structure:
y1 ⊗y2 = Y(r1 ⊗r2, A1 ⊗A2),
unit IY = Y(I, A0), and internal homs [y1, y2] = Y(r1, AA2/A1). The Descent-Ascent adjunction is:
