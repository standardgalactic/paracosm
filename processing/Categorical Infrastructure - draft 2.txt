Plenum: From Entropic Causality to Monoidal Infrastructure

Abstract
This monograph reconstructs the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) within categorical
and sheaf-theoretic foundations, interpreting the scalar-vector-entropy field triad (Φ, v, S) as the
base of a functorial stack.
RSVP supports layers—Unified Field Theory of Coherence (UFTC-
SF), Super Information Theory (SIT), Category of Mind (CoM), Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling
with Annotated Noise (TARTAN), and Yarncrawler—each encoding coherence, information, agency,
simulation, and repair. Yarncrawler unifies these as a monoidal inference engine, modeling reality
as a self-repairing category. Applications to categorical quantum mechanics, topos semantics, and
quantum gravity frame spacetime as emergent from entropic morphisms.
Cohomological proofs,
numerical simulations, and philosophical implications unify physics, cognition, and computation.

Introduction
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) redefines spacetime as a continuum governed by recursive
entropic smoothing, where local field configurations (Φ, v, S) adjust to preserve coherence, manifesting
apparent expansion without inflationary mechanisms [?]. The governing equation is:
∂tΦ + ∇· (Φv) = λ∇2S,
with Φ as scalar density, v as coherence vector, S as entropy potential, and λ a coupling constant.
This work formalizes RSVP through category theory [?] and sheaf theory [?], constructing a stack of
functors: RSVP (R), UFTC-SF (C), SIT (I), CoM (A), TARTAN (T ), and Yarncrawler (Y). Applica-
tions to categorical quantum mechanics [?], topos semantics [?], and quantum gravity are supported by
simulations and proofs.

Literature Review
2.1
Field Geometry and Emergent Spacetime
Einstein's general relativity [?] introduced curvature via Rµν −1
2Rgµν = 8πG
c4 Tµν. Wheeler's geometro-
dynamics [?] and Misner et al. [?] framed spacetime as dynamic. Verlinde's entropic gravity [?], holo-
graphic principles [?, ?], and Jacobson's thermodynamics [?] align with RSVP's entropic smoothing.
Non-commutative geometry [?] informs quantum gravity applications.
2.2
Thermodynamics and Information Theory
Boltzmann [?] defined entropy as S = k ln W, extended by Gibbs [?]. Jaynes [?] unified entropy with
information, followed by Shannon [?], Landauer [?], and Bennett [?]. Quantum information [?] supports
SIT's monoidal structure.
2.3
Categorical Unification
Category theory [?, ?, ?] unifies structures. Sheaf theory [?] and topos theory [?] ensure consistency.
Baez and Stay [?], TQFT [?], and higher categories [?] inform RSVP's framework.

Cognitive Science and Agency
Powers [?], Friston [?, ?], and Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch [?] model agency, supporting CoM's 2-
categorical structure [?].
2.5
Quantum Mechanics and Topos Semantics
Categorical quantum mechanics [?] and topos semantics [?] unify physics and logic, with Loop Quantum
Gravity [?] aligning with TARTAN.

The Base Category R: Entropic Continuity
Define R:
- Objects: Configurations r = (Φr, vr, Sr), satisfying:
∆Φr + ∇· (Φrvr ⊗µr) = 0.
- Morphisms: f : r1 →r2, preserving:

∇· (Φv) dµ +
∫
Ω
˙S dµ = 0.
- Tensor Product: r1 ⊗r2 = (Φ1 + Φ2, v1 ⊕v2, S1 + S2). - Unit: I = (Φ0, 0, 0).
The entropy functor S : R →assigns Sr(Ω). The symplectic form ω = dΦ ∧dv + dS ∧dt links to
Hamiltonian flows [?].

Applications to Categorical Quantum Mechanics and Topos
Semantics
10.1
Categorical Quantum Mechanics
R aligns with dagger-compact categories, with entropic morphisms as CP maps [?]. Y models entangle-
ment, with (Y) as a quantum group [?].
10.2
Topos Semantics
(R) internalizes quantum logic [?], with Y ensuring consistency.

Comparative Frameworks
RSVP compares to: - TQFT: Cobordisms model time evolution [?], unlike RSVP's entropic morphisms.
- Non-Commutative Geometry: Φ, v, S map to spectral triples [?]. - Derived Stacks: R as a
derived object [?].

Empirical Validation
Simulations model Φ, v, S dynamics, mapping ker(di) to curvature and entanglement entropy.

Philosophical Implications
RSVP supports semantic realism [?], where reality is structured by information-preserving morphisms.
Informational structuralism [?] aligns with Y's repair, and category-theoretic phenomenology [?] frames
agency as functorial perception.

work includes experimental validation and philosophical extensions.
