<p>This paper presents a categorical reconstruction of the Relativistic
Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP), interpreting it as a foundational layer in
a hierarchical, higher-order semantic infrastructure. The RSVP is a
theoretical framework that describes physical reality as a continuum
governed by recursive entropic smoothing rather than traditional
expanding spacetime. It consists of three fundamental components: scalar
field (Φ), vector field (v), and entropy field (S).</p>
<p>The paper constructs successive categorical layers built upon RSVP,
each implementing distinct functorial correspondences: coherence,
information, agency, recursive simulation, and infrastructural repair.
These layers are Unified Field Theory of Coherence (UFTC-SF), Super
Information Theory (SIT), Category of Mind (CoM), Trajectory-Aware
Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN), and Yarncrawler.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Base Category R: Entropic Continuity</strong> - This is
the starting point, defining objects as configurations that satisfy a
specific condition ensuring self-coherence of the plenum. Morphisms
preserve coherence, and tensor product combines configurations while
maintaining this property. The entropy functor assigns entropy values to
each configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sheaf of Coherence C: UFTC-SF</strong> - This layer
introduces phase-locked functions (coherence) and their restrictions,

Functor</strong> - This layer defines information density monoids for
each configuration and adjunction between entropy and information
functors, generalizing Shannon’s duality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Category of Mind (CoM): Recursive Agency</strong> -
Representing agents, perceptual transformations, and meta-revisions,
this 2-category models recursive agency and reflection, aligning with
cognitive science theories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TARTAN: Recursive Tiling and Annotated Noise</strong> -
This layer models coherence histories using a grid structure with
cochain complexes, allowing for recursive tiling and annotated

<li><p><strong>Yarncrawler: The Monoidal Infrastructure Functor</strong>
- Yarncrawler forms the monoidal infrastructure that formalizes reality
as a recursively self-repairing category of semantic coherence. It
satisfies specific conditions ensuring consistency, forming a Hopf

</ol>
<p>The paper also proves exactness using cohomological sequences,
demonstrating systemic self-consistency. Applications to categorical
quantum mechanics and topos semantics are discussed, where RSVP models
quantum processes as entropic morphisms, and topos theory internalizes

<p>In conclusion, this categorically reconstructed RSVP unifies physics,

<p>Title: The Categorical Reconstruction of the Relativistic Scalar
Vector Plenum (RSVP)</p>
<p>The paper presents a comprehensive reconstruction of the Relativistic
Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP), a theoretical framework that redefines
spacetime as a continuum governed by recursive entropic smoothing. This
new perspective provides an alternative to traditional inflationary
mechanisms, treating apparent expansion as an emergent property of local
field configurations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Theoretical Framework</strong>: The RSVP is formulated
within category theory and sheaf theory, interpreted through a
functorial stack based on the scalar-vector-entropy triad (Φ, v, S).
This base category, denoted as R, consists of objects representing field
configurations that preserve coherence, morphisms preserving entropy
fluxes, and tensor products that combine configurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Layers of Interpretation</strong>: The paper introduces
several layers built upon the RSVP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified Field Theory of Coherence (UFTC-SF)</strong>: A
layer focusing on coherence aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Super Information Theory (SIT)</strong>: A framework that
interprets entropy as information density.</li>
<li><strong>Category of Mind (CoM)</strong>: A 2-category representing
agents and their perceptual transformations, aligning with cognitive
science theories of agency.</li>
<li><strong>Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise
(TARTAN)</strong>: A method for recursive tiling and noise annotation in
spacetime.</li>
<li><strong>Yarncrawler</strong>: A monoidal inference engine that
unifies previous layers by modeling reality as a self-repairing
category.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Governing Equation</strong>: The governing equation of
RSVP is:</p>
<p>∂tΦ + ∇· (Φv) = λ∇2S</p>
<p>Here, Φ denotes the scalar density, v represents the coherence
vector, and S stands for the entropy potential. The coupling constant is
represented by λ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications</strong>: This model of RSVP has several
applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Categorical Quantum Mechanics</strong>: RSVP’s structures
align with dagger-compact categories, where entropic morphisms can be
interpreted as completely positive (CP) maps.</li>
<li><strong>Topos Semantics</strong>: The internalization of quantum
logic is enabled by RSVP in a topos setting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulations and Philosophical Implications</strong>:
Numerical simulations are presented to model the dynamics of Φ, v, and
S. These simulations map kernel elements to curvature and entanglement
entropy.</p>
<p>From a philosophical standpoint, RSVP supports semantic realism,
informational structuralism, and category-theoretic phenomenology. It
frames agency as functorial perception, aligning with cognitive science
theories of agency.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The paper concludes by highlighting that RSVP unifies physics,
cognition, and computation via Yarncrawler’s monoidal engine. Future
work includes experimental validation and philosophical extensions of
this framework. The Hopf algebra structure of (Y) and the spectral
sequence for cohomology are provided as additional mathematical
underpinnings.</p>

<p>Title: The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP): A Unified
Framework for Entropic Compression and Coherence</p>
<p>Author: Flyxion Research Group Date: October 15, 2025</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper introduces the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) as
a unified field theory that reformulates fundamental physical dynamics
in terms of entropic compression and negentropic reconstitution within a
scalar-vector-entropy field triad. By generalizing concepts from
information theory, variational inference, and signal processing to a
relativistic manifold, RSVP interprets apparent cosmic expansion as
localized entropic smoothing rather than metric dilation, while
gravitational and quantum phenomena emerge as gradients of minimal
description length. Through
Batalin-Vilkovisky-Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz (BV-AKSZ) quantization,
the theory yields an unistochastic quantum formalism, where amplitudes
represent probabilistic coherence audits. Cosmological implications
include redshift as entropy flux and dark energy as entropy pressure,
culminating in a Poincaré-recursive limit cycle that satirizes eternal
return as perpetual defragmentation. Philosophically, RSVP bridges
Gödelian self-reference with Feynmanian pragmatism and Borgesian
labyrinths, arguing that reality persists precisely because it
continually verifies its own checksum. This work provides a mathematical
synthesis of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity,
grounded in the variational optimization of field coherence.</p>

Introduction: From Representation to Reconstitution</h2>
<p>The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) reframes the cosmos not
as an evolving tableau of matter and energy, but as a dynamical archive
engaged in perpetual self-compression. Here, “being” is not a static
predicate but a variational principle: the minimization of descriptive
redundancy under constraints of coherence. Just as a digital file is
encoded to balance fidelity and efficiency, so too does the plenum
reconstitute its scalar density (Φ), vectorial flows (v), and entropic
residuals (S) to persist as a minimally sufficient self-description.</p>
<p>This shift—from representation to reconstitution—addresses a
perennial lacuna in foundational theories: the tacit assumption that
reality is “given” rather than generated. Classical mechanics presumes a
stage; quantum field theory, a vacuum teeming with virtualities; general
relativity, a curved canvas. RSVP, by contrast, dissolves these
substrates into a field-theoretic manifold where space emerges as the
medium of compression itself. The scalar field Φ encodes baseline
structure, akin to a low-pass filter smoothing perceptual redundancies;
the vector field v directs predictive corrections, mirroring error
gradients in autoencoders; and the entropy field S quantifies the
irreducible debt of description, echoing Landauer’s thermodynamic cost
of erasure.</p>
<p>Formally, RSVP’s Lagrangian density minimizes a free-energy-like
functional, where the first term penalizes scalar-vector mismatch
(prediction error), the second enforces flow coherence (smooth priors),
and the third accumulates informational uncertainty. Evolution under
this action yields entropic smoothing balanced by negentropic
feedback—lamphron-lamphrodyne oscillations that preserve macroscopic
invariants amid local diffusion.</p>
<p>Yet RSVP is no mere technical exercise; it is a satirical treatise on
the metaphysics of efficiency. In a cosmos where every bit costs energy
(per Einstein-Landauer), existence becomes an optimization problem: how
to encode infinity with finite resources? The theory’s unistochastic
quantization—deriving quantum amplitudes as analytic continuations of
compression costs—parodies the measurement problem as “rounding error in
self-audit.” Cosmological expansion? Mere artifact of entropy
redistribution. Consciousness? Recursive compression across semantic
scales. Gravity? The slope of descriptive parsimony.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Gödel’s incompleteness (the plenum proves
its own consistency through cyclic recompression), Feynman’s path
integrals (sum over self-descriptions), and Borges’s infinite libraries
(where every book is a checksum of the last), RSVP invites us to view
the universe as a Borgesian aleph: a point containing all points,
compressed into itself. This paper unfolds across seven parts, from
informational analogies to quantum recursions, culminating in a
meta-ethical coda: if reality is compression, then wisdom lies in
knowing what to discard.</p>
