### 1. Algebraic Curvature: The Commutator Geometry of Entropic Descent

This monograph derives curvature from the non-commutation of RSVP field operators (\[Œ¶, S\]), where Œ¶ is scalar potential and S is entropy. It establishes a continuous Lie-algebraic framework, unifying gravity, cognition, and governance as manifestations of thermodynamic tension. Meaning emerges as the residue of non-vanishing commutators within the plenum.
