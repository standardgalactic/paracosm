## Cycle I — Algebraic RSVP: The Foundations of Difference and Flow

### 1. Algebraic Curvature: The Commutator Geometry of Entropic Descent

This monograph derives curvature from the non-commutation of RSVP field operators (\[Φ, S\]), where Φ is scalar potential and S is entropy. It establishes a continuous Lie-algebraic framework, unifying gravity, cognition, and governance as manifestations of thermodynamic tension. Meaning emerges as the residue of non-vanishing commutators within the plenum.

Entropy is reformulated as a maximal ideal within the algebraic ring of RSVP observables. By quotienting this ring, negentropic invariants—patterns persisting through entropic smoothing—are isolated. The text constructs the algebraic spectrum of the plenum, linking physical and ethical order to localizations of informational structure.

### 3. Symmetry Breaking in the RSVP Algebra: From Commutators to Teleology
