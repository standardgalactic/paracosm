Appendix A: Methods for Empirical Estimation of Thermody-
namic Geography
This appendix details the empirical estimation of the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
fields—scalar potential (Φ), vector flow (⊑), and entropy (S)—and the curvature control mech-
anisms via recursive futarchy, addressing the measurement and steering of thermodynamic
geography.
A.1 Estimating RSVP Fields
The RSVP fields are mapped to observable proxies in economic and social systems, enabling
curvature quantification across spatial and temporal scales.
• Scalar Potential (Φ(x, t)): Informational Density
- Proxies: GDP per capita, capital stock, human capital indices, patent filings, R&D
expenditure, nighttime light intensity (VIIRS), broadband penetration, citation density,
venture capital flows.
- Estimation: Aggregate proxies into a scalar field via weighted summation:
Φ(x, t) =
∑
i
wipi(x, t),
where pi are normalized proxies and wi are weights (e.g., PCA loadings or expert priors).
Compute gradients (∇Φ) and Laplacian (∆Φ) using finite differences on a spatial grid
(e.g., 1 km2 cells from OpenStreetMap).
• Vector Flow (⊑(x, t)): Exchange Dynamics
- Proxies: Trade flows (UN Comtrade), interbank transactions, shipping tracks (AIS),
flight origin-destination matrices, migration flows, mobile call-detail records, internet
peering traﬀic, coauthorship networks.
- Estimation: Construct a vector field from flow matrices:
⊑(x, t) =
∑
j
fxj(t) · xj −x
|xj −x|,
where fxj is the flow magnitude from location xj to x. Compute divergence (∇·⊑) and
curl (∇× ⊑) for sources/sinks and circulation.
• Entropy (S(x, t)): Volatility and Diversity
- Proxies: Output/price volatility, forecast error variance, sectoral diversity (Shannon
entropy over NAICS codes), sentiment entropy (from X posts or media), job transition
entropy, innovation diversity (patent topic entropy).
- Estimation: Compute local entropy:
S(x, t) = −
∑
i
pi(x, t) log pi(x, t),
for distributions pi (e.g., sector shares, sentiment categories). Estimate diffusion (∆S)
and production rates ( ˙S) via temporal differencing.

A.2 Curvature Metrics
Key curvature invariants quantify the morphology of value:
• Gaussian Curvature of Φ: K =
det(∇2Φ)
(1+|∇Φ|2)2 , identifying hubs or bottlenecks.
• Flow Divergence: ∇· ⊑, detecting sources/sinks of exchange.
• Entropy Gradient Coupling: ∇Φ · ∇S, measuring innovation driven by capacity gra-
dients.
These are computed on a discretized grid using finite-element methods, with data sourced from
public repositories (e.g., World Bank, OpenAlex).
A.3 Recursive Futarchy for Curvature Control
Recursive futarchy adjusts field dynamics via a predictive tensor Tij, aggregated from market
forecasts.
• Tensor Construction:
Tij =
∑
k
wkEpk [∂iℓk∂jℓk] ,
ℓk = log pk(outcome | state),
where pk are market-implied probabilities, wk ∝(skill×liquidity). Use Ensemble Kalman
Filtering (EnKF) for real-time updates, with eigenvalue clipping to prevent runaway cur-
vature.
• Coeﬀicient Adjustment:
λΦ(t + 1) = λΦ(t) + ϵΦTr(T),
η⊑(t + 1) = η⊑(t) −ϵ⊑∇· T,
αS(t + 1) = αS(t) + ϵS⟨∇Φ · ∇S⟩.
These modulate capacity diffusion, flow friction, and entropy exploration, respectively.
• Feedback Loop: Implement via Model Predictive Control (MPC):
u(t) = arg min
u L(u, T)
s.t.
0 < ˙Scivic(u) < ˙Scrit,
where L balances utility and resilience, and ˙Scrit is calibrated from historical near-failures.
